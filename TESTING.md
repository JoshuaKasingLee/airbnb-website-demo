Component Testing Rationale
For component testing, the general approach we took was to check the following:
  1. Check that the component renders (including quantity of certain elements depending on how many are passed in via component props)
  2. Check that any information it is meant to display is displayed
  3. Check that attributes/props of elements have a value we expect
  4. Check if onClick, onChange functions are triggered upon click and change respectively
  5. Check if the onClick or onChange functions actually cause a value change or change how components are rendered
